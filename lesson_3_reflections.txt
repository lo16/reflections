When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are accessing your code from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

dunno

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork grabs an existing repository from someone else and copies it into your account as your repository. clone copies your repository whether it's on github or local, and saves a copy locally. branch creates another version of your repository in the same location.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

 You can work offline, it saves a lot of data overhead when pushing changes to github and it gives the possibility to do a quick check which changes are made in the online repo compared to the offline repository.
